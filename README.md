# Automated-Shooting-Bot
For my Microprocessor seasonal course, I was determined to create an aimbot that would revolutionize in military applications. However, I encountered several roadblocks due to a lack of proper supervision and resources. Despite these setbacks, I persevered and created a shooting bot that utilized the Haar Cascade Frontal Face Detection Algorithm to detect faces and command the Arduino to shoot.

While I couldn't realize my original vision of creating an aimbot that could adjust its aim automatically, I'm proud of what I achieved. The Haar Cascade algorithm is a sophisticated technique used widely in computer vision applications, and my shooting bot demonstrates its power in a real-world context. Moreover, the integration with Arduino allows for practical applications of this technology, beyond just Military application. It can used in various application for example rescuse bot, surveillance bot and many others.

What I learned from this experience is the importance of being adaptable and creative when facing obstacles in research or development projects. Though it didn't turn out exactly as I had planned, I gained valuable skills and knowledge that will undoubtedly benefit me in future projects. Overall, I'm grateful for the opportunity to work on this project, and I look forward to future explorations and advancements.
